.SH NAME
vlm-tool \- intelligent grep(1) for /var/log/messages files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vlm-tool
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIfile\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This man(1) page gives only the command-line usage.
I know these are a lot of options; see the \fIREADME\fP file for full details.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP
increase level of debug output.
Not useful to anyone other than the developer and probably not even him.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP \fIpattern\fP
Add \fIpattern\fP to list of regular expressions to find.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP \fIfile\fP
Add list of regular expressions from \fIfile\fP, one pattern per line.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP
Colorize the output.
This assigns each host a different color, so that finding related entries is easier.
You do not get any choice about the color selection.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIregion\fP
Change the date parsing to \fIregion\fP.
The default is \fIUSA\fP.
Region \fIISO\fP attempts to decode using the ISO 8601 standard and most of its variations.
.TP
\fB\-G\fP \fIsecs\fP
Recognize a time gap if two log entries for this host are \fIsecs\fP apart.
.PP
Gaps are calculated after uninteresting lines have be dropped.
The intent is to prevent flooding log entries from obscuring the intervals between interesting lines.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP
Flag gaps in the log files.
A gap is recognized when the timestamps on two consecutive line from the same host are more than \fIN\fP seconds apart.
By default, \fIN\fP is 10 minutes.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP \fIfile\fP
Read a list of patterns, one per line, that identifies log entries to be ignored.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP \fIpattern\fP
Ignore log entries matching \fIpattern\fP.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP
Output the table of default trigger patterns.
No other switches are honored if \fB-l\fP is used.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Output all log entries.
Entries matching a trigger pattern will be marked with the \fIthumb\P.
.PP
Some log entries consist of multiple lines and form a \fIstanza\fP.
For example, the string \fBCall Trace:\fP marks a register dump and stack trace.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
Do not load the table of built-in trigger rules.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP
Prefix each output line with a number.
The first line output is one, the next two, and so on.
Ignored or unmatched lines are not counted.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIofile\fP
Write the output to \fIofile\fP instead of the default \fIstdout\fP.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
Show the trigger rule which caused this line to be selected.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Output some statistics at the end.
No really sure why I did this.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fIthumb\fP
Use \fIthumb\fP to mark a matched log entry.
The default thumb is \fI- \fP, to make searching for an interesting log entry simple but you may prefer a different pattern.
Any size thumb will work.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIwhen\fP
This is the approximate time the issue occurred.
The format is exactly the same as the \f(CW/var/log/messages\fP entries.
.TP
\fB\-W\fP \fIwindow\fP
A fuzzy time delta to capture entries before and after the incident time set by the \fB-w\fP switch.
By default, the delta is 24 hours.
The \fIwindow\fP is the number of seconds and can be followed by \fBs\fP for seconds (default), \fBh\fP for hours, \fBd\fP for days, \fBw\fP for weeks.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Print the program version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP \fIyear\fP
Normally log entries do not include the year value.
The current year is assumed, but if you can specify a different year if needed.

.PP
Visually scanning a \fI/var/log/messages\fP file with hundreds of thousands of entries is boring.
On a single-server setup, this tool identifies interesting log file entries for you.
.PP
In a clustered environment, the input files are sorted internally by host and then by date.
